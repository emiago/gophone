Examples:
gophone answer -l 127.0.0.200:5060 
gophone answer -l 127.0.0.200:5060 -code 486 -reason Busy
gophone dial sip:1234@127.0.0.200:5060
gophone dial -sipheader="X-AccountId:test123" sip:1234@server:5060
gophone register -username=sipgo -password=1234 127.0.0.1:5060 

With digest authentication:
gophone dial -ua alice -username=alice1234 -password=1234 "sip:echo@server:5060"

With media:
gophone dial -media=audio sip:1234@localhost:5060
gophone dial -media=mic sip:1234@localhost:5060
gophone answer -media=speaker

With transcribe:
gophone dial -media=log -transcribe sip:1234@localhost:5060

### Media Testing with transcriber

```bash
CALLTRANSCRIPTION=$(LOG_FORMAT=json gophone dial -transcribe sip:49123456789@carrier.xy \
    | jq -r 'select(.caller=="Transcriber" and .text != null) | .text')

test "Please enter your PIN. Your answer is, 1234." = $CALLTRANSCRIPTION
```
